MVP:

An e-commerce site for purchasing custom cake orders

Users can view different pictures of cake options and custom cake names
Users will see the highest rates reviews on the homescreen
Users will be able to purchase different types of cake (fan favorites or custom)
Users can add/remove items from their order
Users can checkout their order and see a receipt of their items purchased

Ideas:
Add tax to the receipt screen
Develop a random delivery time generator (maybe)
